# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

This folder contains my progress through the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

## What I’m Currently Learning
- JavaScript basics like variables, functions, arrays, and objects
- How to write and understand simple algorithms
- Solving beginner-friendly coding problems
- Building up to projects like the Palindrome Checker and Cash Register

## Goal
I'm taking this step-by-step. As I complete challenges and projects, I’ll add them to this folder to track my growth.

## Projects I’ll Eventually Complete
- Palindrome Checker
- Roman Numeral Converter
- Caesar’s Cipher
- Telephone Number Validator
- Cash Register

Stay tuned as I build more and get better.
